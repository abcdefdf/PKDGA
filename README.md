# Introduction

This repository contains the implementations of PDKGA and its competitors. PKDGA is an adversarial domain generation algorithm that uses partial knowledge of the target detector for reinforcement learning training. Its overall achitecture is depected as follows.

# Installation and Usage Hints
PKDGA is created, trained and evaluated on Ubuntu 16.04 or Win10 using Python.

# DGA Reproducibility

## The usages of the rest files in *PKDGA/* are introduced as follows. 

### *rollout.py*: 
  
The fuction of computing policy-based gradient, which makes the token sequence Y resist against target detector D. It is called by the *generator.py* when training PKDGA.

### *gen_model.py*: train the model.  exp1.py: the first experimental code in the paper.  

### *gen_sample.py*: generate domain names by loading the trained model.  

### *exp1.py*: the first experimental code in the paper.  

### *exp2.py*: the second experimental code in the paper.  

### *file_check.py8: other functions that need to be called.


Then we present the brief introduction and usage of the evaluated domain detectors.
## RF
Introduction: DGA detector, it extracts 21 lightweight DGA features, including structural, linguistic and statistical features, and employs a supervised model (Random Forest) for classification.
Usage: Python ./adverse/rf.py

## bilstm,lstm,textcnn
Introduction: DGA detector, directly leverage neural networks to distinguish AGDs from benign ones without extracting features manually.
Usage: Python ./adverse/lstm_class.py -layer -emb -hid -use_cuda
Python ./adverse/lstm_class.py -layer -emb -hid -use_cuda
Python ./adverse/cnn.py  -use_cuda
Python ./adverse/lstmmi.py  -use_cuda
Python ./adverse/cnn-lstm.py  -use_cuda
Python ./adverse/bilstm.py -max_features - maxlen -use_cuda
## graph
DGA detector, graph is able to detect dictionary-based AGDs that are generated by concatenating words from a predefined dictionary. It constructs a graph describing the relationships between the largest common substrings in a domain and the graph with average degrees larger than a threshold is considered as malicious. In our implementation, the substrings that repeat more than three times are considered as basic words, and the degree threshold is set to 3.
## statics
DGA detector, argues that AGDs follow different distributions from the legitimate domain names. A domain is identified as benign if it has a negligible distance from the legitimate domains. In particular, it measures the distance using Kullback-Leibler divergence, Jaccard index and Edit distance.
## khaos
DGA, builds a dictionary containing n-grams of legitimate domain names and trains a wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) to synthesize domain names by merging the sampled n-grams. In our implementation, we set the embedding size of n-grams to 5,000. The domain synthesizer and the discriminator are implemented using the residual convolutional network.
